Dear VOID,

Thank you so much for affording me the opportunity to take the next step in the application 
process!
This is the coolest thing that's happened to me.

PS
This was a very fun learning experience. I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
I know I wasn't able to code things as spectacularly as I wanted. It's been about a year
since I touched C++, so I had to re-familiarise myself with C++ & learn the ImGui api.

If you have critiques, advice, information, or other things that'd be useful, please let me
know! I am always trying to get better at programming.
